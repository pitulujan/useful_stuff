    "# The Objective\n",
    "This exercise revolves around translating a given SQL query into a Python script. The query in question is the ams.rules_input.sql query. \n",
    "\n",
    "**The objective is to generate an exact copy, in a pandas DataFrame, of data_engineer.ams_cms_input_precursor, which is a precursor to the ams.cms_input table in Python.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the Business Value of this Toy Query?\n",
    "The ams.cms_input.sql query aggregates location and status data on our devices. This is required because we have different types of devices that run on different systems - our having multiple systems was an outgrowth of acquisitions (we bought a company called AccentHealth) and the organic creation of new devices (like our WiFi product, which runs on the \"airtight\" system). \"CMS\" stands for ContextMedia Systems, which is how we refer to our systems in their entirety.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Our objective here is to reproduce the data being inserted into AMS.CMS_INPUT_HISTORY in the second statement below.**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The source code is production code - for this exercise, subsets of the tables have been created within the data_engineer schema in the interview database.** \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Query Code\n",
    "The code you will be \"translating\" from SQL to Python is below. You may want to paste it somewhere else for easy reading, since the query is fairly long.\n",
